Microsoft seems to be continuously innovating their tech as of late, which is helpful to sellers.","Microsoft’s inside sales org in Irving, TX is called Digital Sales within Microsoft’s Small, Medium &amp; Corporate business segment. 
When I joined Microsoft, I expected a world class and extremely formalized training program since the company was so large and talks about digital transformation with their customers. Microsoft was the worst and most impersonal onboarding I’ve ever had. They had you do a quick 2 hour meeting with an HR rep, and from there, you’re released to your manager. On day 1, I had boxes of equipment at my desk and was left to unpack and set up all my equipment myself. No one helped me get up and running to ensure I had a successful first day in role. 
Outside of the standard education videos, which are all more Microsoft and product focused, there was no formalized training to set external hires up for success within Microsoft digital sales. 
It surprised me that for a tech company, the sales tools available are very archaic and systems do not talk to one another. For example, I spent the first 2-3 weeks of my job entering Help Desk tickets with India just to wait on various system access and tools needed to perform my job. This added to what’s already a stressful time starting a new job. Dynamics is a very antiquated CRM tool (basically an electronic filing cabinet) &amp; was cumbersome to maintain accurate sales records in the tool. 
Management within the org was highly political and would impose constantly shifting priorities that worked well for those in leadership to meet their scorecard metrics by creating business rules that forced reps to sell certain products for a management scorecard and jump through countless internal approval hoops if the product was not included in a deal. This led to many reps selling through discounting versus solution selling - setting a bad precedent for future deals. 
There was also a shift in how the specialists teams interact with the digital Account Executives. Some of the specialists used to be AEs and work as field-based resources, while other AEs have 100% inside-based specialists supporting their accounts. Seems like eventually Microsoft will pivot to eliminating either one group of resources or the other in the future. As a result, mandates come down for the AEs to upskill by taking various certification exams to achieve deeper proficiency in the workloads. This is fine, but it makes you wonder if the goal is eventually to try and eliminate some of the specialists. Often, it felt like they were trying to pile as much on the AE as possible when the AE role was explained to me as a generalist sales role. 
Many of the managers within digital sales are extremely duplicitous and political, which created a hostile work environment. Policies would be implemented very haphazardly without the proper training and context for the AE community to fully understand the new policies and adhere to them. 
Since it’s Microsoft, there are also a TON of resources (usually contractors) reaching out internally asking you to intro them to your customers or bothering you constantly to let them engage in your accounts. The issue is many of these resources are also inconsistent and not showing value, so you are having to filter through a ton of internal noise and requests for introductions on top of your daily work. 
The majority of the folks there seemed to be hanging on from when Microsoft first opened this sales org due to the relatively high pay for inside sales; however, many of these employees lack the basic skills and Microsoft knowledge to effectively do their job and take care of their customers - they are just there riding the wave. 
I’d advise against the Digital Sales AE role and Specialist roles in Las Colinas unless you’re have worked heavily in the Microsoft ecosystem and come to the role with that background and knowledge of what you are getting into. If you come from another software company, you will likely not get the enablement your need to effectively navigate the complexities of Microsoft and management’s constantly shifting priorities.",4,1,3,"1651"

When covid hit and fast food restaurants started posting their new pay at $14+ they still haven’t found a way to accommodate and adjust the pay for their employees. The benefits are not great- but that’s intentional. They market how they can save companies money on health insurance by making very high deductibles and out of pocket maxes; it’s silly to think they wouldn’t use that on their own company. They made it seem like getting bought by Anthem would be so beneficial for everyone but years later- still no changes in pay or benefits.

No appreciation - you can have a really busy night and still get everything done and more, with not even a thank you. Help out at other branches again with no thank you, from your manager or the manager at the other branch.
Lack of understanding regarding how it is more difficult to sleep during the day due to life noise of the world, light and heat.
Poor attitude and behaviour from management - especially when they are coming in at the end of a long night. 
Lack of training - Training/continuous training is none existent for night staff, my induction was a 9-5 shift during the day in which I spent most of it on a till serving customers on my own. And the only training I got was regarding day shift jobs/procedures. I got 2 night shifts training with 2 Customer Assistants in which they are not paid extra to do, and after that I was pretty much on my own. 
Extra tasks that get pushed onto night shift are not communicated effectively leading to us been scolded because the task wasn't done/done incorrectly, for task which we have never been trained to do. Management just expects us to figure it out. 
Poor ineffective communication - Finding out after going to work that you were suppose to be at another branch therefore no communication regarding working at other stores, telling other store assistants and hoping the message gets through to the right people.

• Consulting allows you to work on multiple projects simultaneously, and switch to new projects regularly, which accelerates learning and introduces you to a wide variety of technologies.","• As a small company that supports many products, you will naturally need to wear a lot of hats and fill in to projects based on the demand of the sales pipeline. It is difficult to become a true expert or keep up with the latest released features in a few products when you need to focus 20-40 hours/week on unrelated products for another project. Because of this, you tend to be a more reactive resource in sales calls or new projects rather than a proactive authority.

- It works like a typical Service based company despite calling itself a product company.

- The so-called products are purely developed as per clients' requirements (projects). So if the same idea is to be used for a different client, everything starts from scratch.

- The Business Leaders (or the VP's) hold too much power. They can hire, fire, speak rudely(even abuse), or impose sanctions without any show cause or review. The Business leaders in KPIT(VPs or AVPs) decided by their tenure of service (15+years) OR nepotism.

- Hike is not connected to performance, it is connected to how much one is drawing. For eg. for Freshers, it would be high(~20%-30%) whereas for experienced it would be(~5%-8%). They may not choose to give a hike at all.

- The company posted Quarter on Quarter profits during CoVid -19 but despite that, they had to impose salary cuts and surgical layoffs.

- Leaves and salary are deducted if one even forgets to fill time-logs. There's no benefit of the doubt at all.

Many many many benefits too

You get to flex that you work in a bank","Your ability to get “outcomes” dictates how well you’re doing the job, nothing else

Your performance is then judged solely off personal opinions of customers put in on a survey. Which has so many flaws I couldn’t begin to list here. 

About 3 different times a customer who has had a bad experience somewhere else with TD say the auto insurance department or the C/C department or a different Branch, comes to my branch days later to do transactions then gets a survey for me but decides to give all reds (Yes this actually happened 3 times) because of his/her/their prior experience, that is not close to being my fault fam. And then the MCEs sit with you talking like i could have done something about it???? No matter how EXEMPLARY my service was, they are forced to voice their opinion completely concerning TD and im the fall guy, then the MCE will say “then why didn’t you ask how their experience with TD was”, in two occasions i did and when they voiced this, all i can do is apologize nothing else, after twice this happened the next time the MCEs just said “it happens” yeah duh, not that its the Managers faults but at least my MCEs sometimes acknowledge the surveys have HUGE FLAWS for frontline associates (LCEA/CEA or Tellers as laymen say) in my 1 year with TD its happened 3 times, I know one coworker who had it happen numerous times in one quarter (3 months). And then when its not the case, customers bash you on this survey for doing your job. You ask for ID for transactions that need it they get annoyed “(Sir/Ma’m) its compliance, we are protecting you, and us and most importantly your money from any cases of fraud” and then they say “i been with td for blah blah blah years, why you asking for id” Sir i dont’ know you?? I am new and i have never seen you? (I would not be this rude obviously) so I declined to process the transaction, but because they did other transactions with me before, then they get a survey and give all reds, reason cause i did my job, followed rules and compliance, and then they sit me down and complain and I’m just sitting there like you fam CANNOT be serious (in my head 😂). I did my job and you are complaining?, my bad I should have given a lady 10000$ from her A/C with no ID, she claims to have got up to walk her dog so she out of no where needs 10 bands?? HAHAHAHA , she had space for her ACS Card (Debit card) but not Gov ID, and you guys are upset at me for declining like you all told me to do??? THATS RICH. I guess I should have called a manager oh wait i did that once before and the same manager told them the same thing (We need ID for this transaction unfortunately) THAT SAME MANAGER looked me in the eye and said “you shoulda called me or any other mces or the branch or assistant branch manager” what DIFFERENCE would it have made? Haha. Then they said HR has to know blah blah blah yea whatever. HR didn’t even say anything, i doubt they gave a care about it.

With that in mind, please be more cognizant of your employees' mental health and daily responsibilities. The pay is so egregiously low that it seems borderline criminal if not evil to deny a monthly bonus based on failing an insignificant metric like returning late to your desk after using the restroom. No one, and I cannot emphasize this enough, NO ONE enjoys your hokey incentives to increase efficiency and business profitability. Recording your employees on the phone dealing with upset customers while dancing around and blasting Pharell's song ""Happy"" is about as close as I can imagine the 7th circle of hell resembles. Coupons for a cup of soup for bringing in a million dollars in 30 days is bombastically insulting. Pay your employees better, allow them to share in appreciation days without giving them the uneaten portion of cold hamburgers and hotdogs, be more flexible with PTO, and admit that there are serious flaws with the coverage you provide in your policies to external customers.","https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Overview/Working-at-Allianz-EI_IE3062.11,18.htm","https://www.glassdoor.co.uk/Reviews/Allianz-Reviews-E3062.htm?filter.iso3Language=spa&filter.employmentStatus=INTERN&filter.employmentStatus=FREELANCE&filter.employmentStatus=REGULAR&filter.employmentStatus=PART_TIME&filter.employmentStatus=CONTRACT&filter.employmentStatus=TEMPORARY","1. The building that the headquarters in Richmond is located in is very nice.","1. No matter what they tell you, it's an inbound call center.  You are expected to be available on the phones from the literal second (that's recorded) you log on, to the literal second (also recorded) you log off. You are given two 10 minute breaks, and a choice between a 30 minute or 60 minute lunch. If you choose the latter, your day is extended to accommodate the lost time on the phone. 
2. If you somehow end up in this situation with a degree, you will be reporting to an immediate supervisor whose highest tier of education is high school. This individual is responsible for pulling calls you took, supposedly at random, and critiquing them. If you fail an absurd metric, such as forgetting to provide a canned sequence of information at the end of a call, you will fail. Fail a call and you will forfeit any possibility of seeing a monthly bonus. 
3. Monthly bonuses: During my time in this position, my team generated premiums in excess of one million dollars every month for six months straight. If you failed a call, you would not realize any bonus for your contributions.  Fear not, for you WILL receive a rubber bracelet similar to the LIVE STRONG bracelets that instead reads ""Million Dollar Club.""  In addition, you will receive a coupon for a cup of soup redeemable at the cafe downstairs in the lobby. 
4. Employee Appreciation Days: Other departments are invited and welcome to join outdoor cookouts and half days with a cold beer. It looked very pleasant actually. I would have enjoyed them had we not been required to remain on the phones to continue servicing calls instead.
5. Staff Development: Career development is probably something that is valued in other departments. However if you are one of the unfortunate souls that make up the claims, customer service, or sales departments - you're doomed. During my two years there, I knew of only one person able to break out of these departments in a vertical transition to something like Finance, Underwriting, or Marketing. 
6. Weekends &amp; Holidays: If you are in this role, you will be working alternating weekends. I have heard that since I left, you actually are compensated better for the mandatory weekend rotations. That being said, you are also expected to work Holidays. Every time you work a holiday, you accrue points. If you have enough points by the time a major holiday rolls around, say Christmas, there is a lottery system in place that works like a draft. If you do not have enough holiday points, you're working Christmas. While I was there, I worked every major holiday including Easter, Thanksgiving, and Christmas.
7. Hourly Pay: As stated above, I'm aware that there has since been adjustments to the hourly rate of CSR and Sales. When I was there, the base pay for normal business schedule was $13 / hour. If you wanted to see the most pay, you had to be willing to work from 4:00PM until midnight for $15 / hour. 
8. PTO: You must accrue the PTO before you can actually use it. You may not take off the same day that someone else on your team has reserved. There must always be enough people on the phones to service calls. 
9. The calls: Be prepared to deal with the absolute worst that this planet has to offer in terms of humanity or lack-thereof. You are the front lines for servicing phone calls for disgruntled customers that were foolish enough to fall for the product this company sells in the first place. The majority of your calls will be to either refund people that mistakenly purchased the policy at the time of purchasing tickets, or sell the policy itself, or notify a customer that their claim is not covered by the policy. I unfortunately had to tell numerous cancer patients that their condition was considered pre-existing and likely would not be covered by the policy at the time that they filed. By the end of the day, it was more common that I received some sort of death wish from a cancer patient than not. I can't say that I blame them. 
10. Management: They are aware of all of this. They do not care. They will always have a pool of people to draw from that hold a high school diploma, or are under employed with a bachelor's degree.",1,2,1,"3062"

Raises were not given for a solid two years until a large majority of stylists quit. They offer performance based bonuses but because of cut hours, it just barely brought your paycheck back up to what it usually was, so it really did not feel like a bonus at all.

Their payments are later than late, and if you make use of their moving package, you're basically bound to them for several months. And then is the question if you will ever see the money again. The salary offered is just a joke, without any compensation. 

Once enrolled, it might look impressive, but it's not. First two weeks are vague, but it will fall together later. Then there are another 2 weeks, where they will teach you what you can't say. Just throw it out of the window once you start. Just call the people and beg them to work with you. Straight out of the training there is no one that will help you, you have to figure it out. They only care about numbers and how many you have reached. You are a number to them, and if you are not able to perform you will get a lot of judgement and look downs. 

The company itself is just one hot mess, especially when it comes to documentation, finance and communication. No person is treated the same and basically you sit there with your brave face, waiting to go home. No matter how independent you are, it is a job that requires no feelings, a lot of lying, and a skin so thick and strong no drill can enter. If you are not an agent, you're doomed to get the lowest of the lowest tasks, which is basically taking the remainings.

- The business is creaking under an enormous amount of tech debt. The C-suite refuse to engage with this problem as they have a poor grasp of technical concepts (and won’t listen to anyone who understands it), which means tech debt gets consistently deprioritised.

- High turnover in engineering leadership roles. Plus Freetrade has been without a CTO for 1.5 years now. Huge red flag for a tech company.

- Nobody in the C-suite has experience scaling a company at this stage of growth and it shows. The CEO has made a lot of bad bets in the past 1-2 years, takes almost no accountability for them and is clearly way out of his depth.

- Freetrade had an early mover advantage but the competition has come on leaps and bounds while Freetrade’s app has stagnated.

- The C-suite don’t care about employees. During the recent redundancy process they rescinded job offers, lied to employees about the number of redundancies needed (the figure turned out to be 2.5x higher than initially quoted), extended all probations so people made redundant would only get paid 1 week’s notice, etc.

- Lousy comms from leadership. The responses to recent reviews on here are a good example: zero empathy, lots of buzzwords, and not directly addressing concerns/criticisms that are raised.",2,1,"",""

Atleast acting like you care enough about your employee to help them assist the customer(s), who you also claim you care so much about. I have NEVER witnessed such unprofessionalism, utter lack of management and a sorry example of what customer service meant until I worked as a customer service representative at this company. NEVER have I ever heard of a supervisor being too busy to assist a customer and their issues when the customer does not want to talk to an employee and wants to talk to someone ober them. There are currently between 80,000 and 100,000 people in an employee chatroom and somehow not a single supervisor is available to help their employee help a customer????? Something does not add up. Never in the 23 going on 24 years of living have I ever heard of a customer wanting to speak to a supervisor or manager but neither are available. 


I wouldn't even recommend this job to a teenager just finishing highschool and wanting to join the workforce. If you are a highschool student about to graduate and join the workforce, you are better off working at McDonald's or some other fast food joint/retail area where a supervisor and/or manager IS available to assist a customer that wants to speak to one. This company is a disgrace to customer service. Such a stressful job when dealing with understandably angry customers, and barely anyone is around to help you when a customer wants to speak to someone higher than you. And this company has the AUDACITY to pay $14.50/hr to their employees for this???

The hours of banking are not realistic dues to the fact that processing is closed at 4p.m. and workers have little to no time to balance life and work. Sale goals aren't realistic I'm got against growth but not all the products  don't work for everyone  for an example   an 82 yr old customer who enjoys coming to the bank to do all his/her banking needs and have no clue about the internet will not use online banking  because when u know the customer well enough it makes no sense to pressure him/her into getting it.

3. High-quality technical process and an appreciation for best practices.
4. Amazing networking opportunities. Google interns come from and end up all over the place, so being an intern is a great opportunity to meet lots of different people.","1. Lack of real respect for individuals. This is a symptom of Google being a large company with incredible scope to pick and choose people, along with having many excellent people. You are treated well at the surface level because you were able to get through the interviews and meet the obligatory standards, but you are not treated as an individual outside of your team's breadth. In addition, while you don't see rank explicitly pulled very often, the company is very top-down in policy and culture. I doubt this is a Google-exclusive issue, and in fact it's very common in large companies across the world. It's certainly easier to ignore at Google than other places and you are pampered in a number of ways. If you want that sort of gritty individual respect from the organization, work at a small company. 

2. Intern-specific: for full-time conversion, interviews can overshadow contributions to individual host teams. Interns are often left with the decision of maximizing their acquisition of gainful skills and their contributions to the company, or passing up on an opportunity for full-time employment at Google. Interview skills in tech are, at higher levels, focused on things that may not be application-specific for the intern's project, even if they are working on something of significant business value.

One positive note is there have been some strides in user education around security.","So where to begin... the IT department is plagued by innumerable issues that are mostly self-inflicted.
Number one with a bullet is management, a team which has undergone a complete changeout over the last few years. One of the last competent managers, who was a calm voice of reason, retired early out of frustration with the new leadership.

There's been a tonal shift in department culture. Morale is low and the department's panicky management style encourages finger pointing and contention among the staff. There are unclear standards around change management, and how to work with other teams within the department that never get addressed. Everyone is on edge, and there’s repeat offenders who will belittle and disparage other staff in meetings.

They actually had a doctor, a business psychologist, come in a couple years ago to interview the staff in small groups. Feedback from the staff was almost unanimous, but it seemed like the doctor’s report and suggestions were thrown out since it was critical of the director and deputy director.

The department is stuck in gridlock. There are a lot of half-baked processes, and then new processes and new committees to figure out why the processes aren’t working. 
Have a question? Your direct manager will either be unavailable or won’t know how to help you because they’re unsure of the direction the director wants them to take, or they’ll point you to another manager who’s just as unconfident.

County staff have become unhappy with IT, and aren’t shy about sharing that with you when you work with them. I can’t blame them because it’s hard to get help or work just isn’t being done.
There’s a process for what projects you’re supposed to work on, but management will quickly shoehorn a different #1 priority project/issue onto your plate, usually weekly, or anytime there’s a fire caused by their poor planning or some highly visible problem that makes the department look bad. 

Your head will be spinning trying to track your time in tickets, a time log, your outlook calendar, and your time card (while making sure it’s properly coded to the right work order).",3,1,"",""

Management is either so invested in creating and selling a façade that things aren't bad, broken, failing (we're a happy family they say!) that they actually believe it or more alarming don't see the reality. Tech is broken or unstable, competitors are seizing up market share and new logos, turnover across departments is crippling and morale just sinks lower. Yet upper management will force a smile and say ""things are fine"" with better fortunes just around the corner. How long you believe the latter part is what you'll wrestle with before seeing the only logical choice which is to exit a company decaying from the inside.",3,1,"",""

It is not paid for by the company. 
It makes better sense to put my mental health first which means leave the company and then theoretically there is less of a desperate need and want for great health insurance. They thrive on knowing that people mainly chose to stay after all the injustice just for the health insurance. They thrive on keeping people unwell. Sounds all too familiar (like how our ""health care"" industry is run in this country).

Scott Nash gives power away to the most mediocre people and they take the power to their head and absolutely hold it over other people. Scott Nash cares about profit over people and planet. His greed of money and power is evident as the company continues to grow while the staffing becomes less and less. I have met few really great people here and they either quit or get fired unfairly - or are threatened off the clock so nothing can be done about it with HR. 

""If you can't beat them, join them"" only works if you have numbers because there is power in numbers. Do not think for a single second that you alone will change ANYTHING about how this place is run from the top down. To begin, the company needs a new owner and nearly all of management (lower and upper) needs to be replaced. That won't happen.

Management is literally the WORST I've ever experienced and this comes from someone who has worked in and with the public for greater than 12 years in a variety of retail spaces. The mediocrity of people they put in management will leave you laughing - because it is very much a joke. Managers who bully, harass, or are totally absent minded. Brainless. Heartless. Lacking compassion. Self serving. Ego addicts. Drug and sex addicts - while on the clock!!! Managers who work in pajamas and rags for clothes, people who downright smell fowl and need to shower - what a way to set an example of self respect but yet they expect us to respect them.

Management does not live up to, nor do they set good examples for, the company values. All that while being encouraged to speak your truth and you dare risk your job if you do! Only expect HR to protect your job IF it is convenient for them to do so. Otherwise, expect to get fired.

The company knowingly employees thieves and sexual predators, harassers and offenders, and less and less cares about the employees at the bottom level which is evident given the lack of security cameras, because the owner Scott does not believe in using them - so basically you work at your own risk of being thieved from or worse, sexually, emotionally, and psychologically abused. So much abuse of power. So much abuse against humanity. It's literally the same stuff you see in the media but on a smaller scale and at a local level.

NOT a ""green"" job for you if you truly care about the environment, will only make you mad and stress you out to be so exposed to people who actually do not care, workers and customers both. Didn't even mention the amount of financial waste that happens here, mostly due to pure human error, yet you are told there is no money for wage increases (but yet they keep opening new stores with little to no team to even recruit). 

It doesn't matter if you have a family to support or if you are single-handedly keeping plastic bags from becoming trash by turning them into new, repurposed goods. IT'S NOT WORTH SACRIFICING YOUR MENTAL HEALTH. IF YOU TRULY CARE ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT, WORK FOR A DIFFERENT COMPANY. It's easier to know from the start you are working with people who openly don't care versus working with people who pretend to when its convenient for them.

There’s a lot of fun company events and contests.","I ’ll start by saying the biggest issue at JFQ is the training department. It’s no secret that most of the trainers have little to no mortgage experience or experience training people in general. Senior processing training is basically just one week, they focus completely on streamlines but even that training is minimal. Once you’re “out on the floor” you’re straight up told not to ask questions and to Google before approaching a lead. Eventually they start assigning you conventional and full doc loans without warning when you haven’t been trained on them at all - leadership expects you to work them without making any mistakes. It seems like there’s a big disconnect on what is covered during senior training and what isn’t, I could tell senior processing leads would get frustrated with the lack of proper training new seniors were getting.
This leads to the second issue, job security. Turnover is HIGH - either people leave unhappy or they’re fired without reason. The last few months there have been mass firings, entire departments let go yet they claim they’re not having money issues? 
Pay is horrible and way below the industry average. Save yourself the trouble and look elsewhere.",1,2,"",""

By adding a line in contract that says "" your salary covers for all time required to complete your job"" company thinks they can make people work like slaves. 

Company introduced unlimited leave policy to fool around and lure talent. The ground reality is people do not have time to take even standard  4 weeks of annual leave. And this has nothing to do with Covid times. Company had to force employee to take long weekends to get things right in the books as many had as many as 3 months of accumulated outstanding A/L . So if you are tempted with unlimited leave policy its just a hoax. No one have ever managed to enjoy this perk.

-This company gave me exposure to cybersecurity. I wouldn't have the job I have now if I didn't start here.

-Only company that was fun. Most of the SOC guys and developers arrange breaks to play video games or shoot pool.","-Atrocious pay. Every coworker I knew had roommates, including my first boss who was there for 4 years. Compared to what I'm paid now, it's downright pathetic. Starting out, you make the same hourly pay, or slightly more, than an In-N-Out employee.

-Novacoast might call themselves ""tight-knit"", but it's really just nepotism. When I started there, the majority of people in my department had some type of friendship/relationship with the manager before they were hired.

-If you're not into Reddit-type humor or gaming, you'll feel out of place. Most of the employees are students or recent graduates, because the SOCs are purposely built in college towns so they can farm cheap, naive student labor. 

-Huge employee turnover. I noticed two types: 
a) my first manager quit and all his minions followed
b) Guys who worked there for a month or two and found out it sucks, either because the rest of the guys on his shift don't pull their weight or because they got stuck on night shift where they're the only employee present. Honestly, I can't blame those guys. I worked in the SOC and we would just keep getting new customers piled on us. A very dangerous formula for an undermanned, underpaid staff that needs to be staffed 24/7. But there is always a fresh stream of students looking to break into cyber, and Novacoast knows that, so it's all good in their eyes.

I stayed for 2 years and felt like that was enough. I've scanned all the guys from my department who are in my LinkedIn, and they've all left Novacoast. There is much better money to be had elsewhere. If you land a position in the Kansas or Michigan locations, it might not be so bad because of the cost-of-living.",1,2,"",""

When a skill was missing that wasn't yet in the quiver, WPG quickly recognized and made smart hires to address those needs. 

The most considerable pro to my tenure on the marketing team would be that Jennifer and her team hire professionals and quickly trust their decisions as subject matter experts in the digital space. I can speak to being challenged to think more significantly, leverage instruments to exceed expectations, and the inspiration to bring meaningful solutions to problems we identified. 

During my time with the WPG Brands team, we shifted the mindset from acting as a thermometer and understanding when tension was elevating into a thermostat which allowed for fluid adjustment to act calm when faced with difficulty. This shift was made possible with the leadership of Kimberly. She served as a conductor that turned a series of loud noises into a steady tempo through the shuttering of both Shelby's and Tangible Collective brands.","No company is perfect, which is why this earned a 4-star review. My most significant drawback is that WPG did not set itself up for success within the digital landscape. As I signed off my computer for my next adventure, a distant digital light was at the end of the tunnel, and I am confident it will only grow in the coming years. Unfortunately, WPG couldn't cash in on years of website data to better understand the content driving the communities in the town centers that fund commerce.

- I think this company is perfect for fresh college graduates. Stay and learn here for a year or two.","- Employees. CB4 boasts they continually improve the conditions of their employees and that it’s striving to become an employer of the year by winning various awards from places like Inc.com and builtinnyc.com among others. But If you look at LinkedIn data, the medium tenure hasn’t changed since 2009. This means people don’t stay with the company longer, so CB4’s claims of any ‘positive’ changes are not working.

- Customers. Not great advocacy from customers. If you check out their case studies page online, you will notice that majority of the case studies they were able to secure were small, regional convenience stores. By the way, about 5 of these case studies are irrelevant as some of them are no longer CB4’s customers.

- Product. Currently, CB4’s main and only focus is for brick and mortar retailers. Physical retail space is a tough market to be in this digital age. Each year globally more and more people change their buying habits to online as it offers more convenience, safety and saves them time. Many brands leverage rich interactive online experiences that replace those that retail spaces used to offer so there’s less and less incentive to go to the physical store. In my opinion, if CB4 doesn’t rethink its core product offering and re-orient itself to start thinking about shifting global behavior patterns it won’t survive for long.

- Finances. The company doesn’t seem to be financially solid. Any small changes in the market or a loss of a customer almost certainly is going to send a shock wave throughout the entire company. So be ready to navigate in rocky waters if you decide to work there.


Other things worth mentioning:

- Drives image of inclusion and diversity but more of a marketing ploy than a practiced culture. See their leadership page. There are no BIPOC or female VPs as of (April 2021).

- Politics and top-down hierarchy.

- They make people sign vicious and inhuman one-way NDAs and separation agreements. People basically waive any rights to speak up. Don’t be surprised to see so many positive reviews and so little negative ones for that exact reason.",3,1,"",""

Even if you accrued enough PTO to see your family, you felt guilty using too much of it because you would be letting others down being gone for too long. As a family we were suppose to forgive FAST for their mistakes (not getting the project you wanted, having to do crappy tasks, traveling at a moments notice to fix someone else's mistake) but if you messed up once you are basically shunned like a pariah, and a lot of the company talks about your mistakes for years to come sometimes. 

It also took me stepping away to realize how much sexual harassment was blatant. By the partners themselves, by the client, by the coworkers, it is disgusting. And reaching out to other higher-up women in the company to talk to them about it (which I did on multiple occasions) just gets you told that 'that's how it is' and 'I went through the same thing'.

Management ( mostly upper, but also some middle ) is composed of highly incompetent people that eventually will ruin everything. 

Promotions happen only if the manager likes you and there have been several cases of people promoted into management over night and without any interviews or tests, just because a senior manager has been pulling the right strings. 

HR has no power - I hope I'll never see any other company like this, where HR says no to promoting a shady person as manager and nobody listens to them.

No empathy to their employees - the last round of layoffs was done just before the holiday season. Just imagine celebrating Christmas knowing this was your last paycheck...

Compensation below market. But somehow, if your salary is ok for a senior you are expected to work day and night only because there's a junior in your team who makes half of your paycheck. The manager will tell you repeatedly that you are paid a higher amount, so you need to prove that you deserve it. 

Work/life balance is a nightmare in some departments, while others do nothing for days in a row. People in specific departments were being overworked even before all the layoff rounds, so now it's simply unbearable. 

Female employees are often undervalued and unappreciated - especially in tech positions. Somehow being a good engineer can only happen if you are a male. That is also another toxic management trait. 

They hire now, only to kick people out - sometimes even in weeks time. If you are looking for a job, search further. 

If you are still there and you are not looking for a job you better start, before you find out you are on the next layoff list.",2,1,"",""

Management is not forward thinking. Being in the middle of a recession, working on top dollar computers be they desktop or laptop for a starting 15 an hour is almost criminal for a technical job that requires an attention to detail at production speed. Not to mention the work is back breaking, and depending on which department you get, your colleagues could be less than professional. On that subject, the amount of workplace animosity that flies around is horrendous, it doesn't help that the quotas that are set, provide the perfect breeding ground for a toxic working environment. Communications to the upper echelon is slow, any request you might want to make, any change you need to work better barring anything medical is usually shot down. You will be standing at all times, because the company subscribes to the idea of standing = better production. The training, if you can even call it that, is non-existent, and the procedure by which you work is ever fluctuating. And, the best thing of all, while you endure the day, best hope you don't have a configuration set wrong, or a clip on the back of a laptop isn't properly set. Tiny things like that, which could be easily fixed by the Quality Assurance technician in each department, will result in an NCI or Non-Compliance Issue.

Unlimited PTO, free lunches and dinners, after hours company events. It seems great. But then reality quickly sets in and the brutal truth appears. There is no work balance, people pull in 10, 12, 14 hour days weekly. The workload is impossible to get through in a normal 8 hour work day but you are expected to get it done. Being paid salary and having no OT, the hours are brutal and unhealthy. I have seen multiple people break down to tears because the stress is just too much. The production team work on the weekends and on holidays to get their work done and the team’s morale is always at an all time low. There is a reason there are only a handful of employees that have been there over a year. It’s surprising when anyone reaches their year mark and should be a red flag to anyone applying. There are anonymous polls that go out monthly asking employees to leave their honest remarks on how LL can do better and address certain problems. I’m not sure if these surveys are sent directly to the trash bin, but there has never been a single response to help address employee’s concerns. Instead they will distract you with a pizza party. The actual team is all incredible, it’s why most people stay for as long as they do. Management has no grasp of reality on how to support their team instead they focus on shifting blame and finding scapegoats. If people don’t quit on their own after reaching their breaking point, they are fired out of nowhere with no explanation.

When I started, the company was diversifying and expanding, as the CEO and top executives saw the peril of being reliant on one industry, especially one as cyclical as automotive. The new hire training program was one of the best I'd ever experienced, and the team was supportive and helpful. The company was losing money in the short term due to its long-term investments, which apparently spooked Wall Street after a few such quarters.

Since Phil Eyler started, there have been the highly demoralizing constant threats of layoffs and pay and benefit cuts. Within 3 months of his arrival, there was a round of layoffs that cut 10% of the headquarters (engineering, program management, sales, etc.), mostly those with experience (and therefore the highest pay), but not management, of course. Top level executives not on board with the new direction quit within a year and were replaced by yes-men from Eyler's former team at Harman. When COVID started, we all took a 20% ""pay deferral"" due to the plant shutdowns, which we were willing to do since it was to avoid layoffs. In the fall of 2020, the financials were sound enough to restore full salaries and back pay... And a month later, surprise layoffs! More followed in the spring of 2021. Again, it was the experienced employees that got the axe.

Given these changes, culture has shifted from collaborative to competitive, with those best at sucking up and covering for themselves remaining, while those with years of experience get to train their newly graduated replacements and then be shown the door. The numbers look great in the short term, but this isn't the way to foster innovation (one of the company's taglines). Revenue is increasing thanks to price cuts leading to new business, but this trend will reverse once the products are no longer competitive.

Meanwhile, much ink is spilled to the press about the company's commitment to diversity and inclusion, while really it's just for show - there's no diversity (not least of which is diversity of opinions) at the executive level. Foster a nurturing and supportive culture, and the diversity will follow organically without the dog and pony shows. The actual women on our team mostly thought the Gentherm ""Women's Network"" was a joke.

I can't recommend anyone work here until the CEO and his entire cabinet are replaced. I shudder to think what the culture where he came from must have been to have made him this way.",4,1,"",""

unlimited PTO (but who really feels comfortable using it)","My experience as an employee ultimately ended terribly and I would not suggest anyone else work here. 

I was so excited to be apart of a company that seemed to truly care about their employees and the community in which they operated. Unfortunately after about 11 months with the company, I learned that was not the case.

On my 3rd day of onboarding, the company shut down the department I was hired in. They asked me to move to their sales department, in which I had 0 experience. Once I got into that department, they required me to change my original hours of 8-5 to work the 10-7 shift. That really negatively affected my family but we endured and preserved. In addition, I went above and beyond in that role and was promoted w/ a pay raise w/in 2 months. They then required the team to get their real estate license which took 6 months of studying outside of work hours. That also took me away from my family because of the weekly deadlines I needed to meet. I had to study on the weekends and late evenings. 

Ultimately, I ended up passing and receiving my license for them. However, 2 weeks later they asked me to move back into the department they originally hired me to be in. I was excited to go back but kind of bummed I wasn’t going to be able to utilize the license I just spent 6 months sacrificing for.

When I got to the original department, they heard so many great things about my work ethic in the sales department that they “promoted” me to a role that I did not apply, interview or fully understand the roles and responsibilities. I immediately expressed my reservations about the role but they said it would be fine, they would train me. The first 3 months in the new role (but original department) was slow because they were still recovering and setting up from the previous closure. After 1 month of being fully operational, I re-expressed my concern of the promotion so they said they understood and respected my honesty and put me back into the role I originally was hired for (10 months since being hired). After two weeks into the role, they fired me saying that I didn’t seem to be a good fit for Sundae. After I adapted to EVERY change they through my way. I was even one of the top 3 performers in their sales department for 8 months straight. They gave me a week of severance and sent me packing. They didn’t even offer me to move me back to sales but I soon found out why. 

1 month later, they did a huge lay off and gave those employees a much larger sum of severance. I believe this is maybe their 2nd or 3rd layoff in their 3 years of business. I genuinely believe they just wanted to avoid laying me off and used my honesty against me. I have way more to say but my fingers hurt lol.

And that’s true, people (who are not leadership) are incredibly kind, hard working people. You will find someone who has their own personality and you never have to worry about being yourself. And that definitely makes it a nice place to work. But people and the actual company/work, are two different things. 

People aside, there isn’t much about MT that makes it competitive to the job market. The overall consensus is ‘It’s not bad” from people who came from much worse jobs. Seems to be MT’s bread and butter-- getting people who are extremely unhappy with their current job and use their values as a smoke and mirror to lure new employees in. And that could absolutely be what you need. However, if you know your worth, you’ll quickly learn that you’re underpaid, overworked, and have no growth. 

This is particularly prevalent in less regarded departments where growth is not only non-existent, but it’s common to hold a carrot in front of you with the promise of growth without any actual plan on how that path to growth would be achieved. Do the extra work first, and MAYBE we’ll start eventually talking about where you can go from your job position...even though your responsibilities have already changed and you’ve exceeded these expectations. 

People are underpaid. It’s a well known thing (again, outside of sales) once people realize the work that they do for the amount they receive. You’ll also learn quickly which positions MT values and which ones they deem replaceable.  It's very easy to just take a look at the market of the same event management/project management jobs within either the industry or outside with similar job descriptions and see very quickly that these jobs have a 10-15k+ higher pay. 

Leaderships, is well, very inexperienced, and that can be concerning. They are generally unapproachable, have a cold demeanor, and avoid conversations from most people. Leadership is either unaware of the issues that employees are experiencing, such as capacity, or blissfully ignorant and unwilling to actually make change. Having such leaders with a limited scope of experience doesn't help anyone. 

Final Thought: Only rewarding Sales, having incompetent leadership, and having a company boast about their values without actually delivering is not uncommon, nor is it unique to MT. That is common practice and that’s never going to change. They do not live up to their values, nor do they grasp that they are not competitive in a job market. In a recession market, maybe. In a thriving economy, they are subpar. Only advice is to treat this job as a transition, or acknowledge that there is little growth for you, which you may like. Set limits with yourself and your manager to not be overworked nor have them take advantage of your skill set for the same pay. Be smart and be strategic, because they aren’t.",2,1,"",""

However, what pushed me over the edge and made me decide to write this review is the fact that I was sold a dream, and I feel I was deceived and lied to. My recruiter sold me a dream of making 65k on average during the first year. I made 0 (zero) in 2 months and quit. Lying about pay is common in the recruitment for sales positions, but it's still inexcusable, especially when the other firm I interviewed with, the local Coldwell Banker, was extremely honest with me and told me the average first year agent in their firm makes 17k their first year, which aligns with National averages. When I was reading these reviews, yes there were warnings but the warnings were too general, they could really be applicable to any and all real estate firms, and so I decided to sign on with Mark Spain. Originally about 10 people were recruited for our class. 7 didn't make it past the first Zoom meeting. Out of the 3 people left, it was me, a woman, and a frat boy who is literally still in college. First red flag. When the 3 of us first arrived at the office, it was in the same building a couple doors away from Raleigh Marketing Consultants, which is a branch office of Cydcor/Smart Circle, a well-known MLM pyramid scheme. Second red flag. The unpaid training is about 2 weeks. Before and during the training we were assigned to shadow 5 agents. I was the only one who didn't get any shadows before or during the training. Not sure if it was because I am Asian. When I emailed the director to ask why, I did not get a response for some time. She is very fast to respond to all emails, except on this one occasion. After our unpaid training, the woman quit, so it was just me and the frat boy. Now I have nothing against boys in frats, it's just this particular person takes every opportunity to remove his mask but on one occasion for reasons unknown he put on his mask when I came into the room. 2 months after training I guess I just had enough and wanted to make some money, so I quit. They play games. The first lead they gave me was someone who cancelled a month ago and never rescheduled, and they said oh what the heck give it to him. When I called to confirm the appointment, after doing hours of work, the lead said she had no idea of any appointments. After getting one joke lead after 2 months, I decided to quit. Right when I was about to quit, they tried to give me another lead. Even though I didn't have another job lined up, I was still not about to play that game, and I stuck to my guts and quit anyways.

During the interview process they make you believe the company is progressive, you will have the opportunity to be apart of something, and that you are helping the community. Truth is, it’s a money grab to enrich the upper management. For a company that has no other viable income sources (except the cable company fees residents pay) and has not developed anything to bring in new income they make an exorbitant amount of money. If you want to verify, It’s a nonprofit you can look up the incomes.
If you become an employee, upper management works very hard at distancing themselves from their employees, there is no respect for your talents, or your professional opinion. The staff is unhappy and the culture is toxic. There is a vindictive attitude towards employees, especially if you leave, so don't think you can ever use them as a reference for future employment.
When employees leave the organization, their positions are usually not replaced and other departments are forced to absorbed their workload with no change in salary. Only a select few get raises or title changes and there is little to no upward mobility in the company. 
The CEO micromanages everyone, let that sink in. You may ask how does he get his job done, the answer is he doesn’t. He prevents dept. heads from doing their jobs, so in comparison he looks stellar. When he has to make important decisions he freezes up and makes no decision until he is pushed. If the idea is not his, he will reject it and then reintroduce the idea as his own, with new semantics.

Varo called themself a fintech but they are nothing but a regional bank, penny-pinching, and slow to move. 
2. Varo claims to have more than 4 million customers but a very small portion of it is daily active. Avg customer account balance is in double-digit and most are $0, Their target customers are unbanked and low income, while its a noble idea to provide financial services to this segment, but there is a good reason why large banks avoid this segment. Its too expensive and doesnt contribute to profit. Unfortunately, people with $0 struggle with daily expenses, and they cannot use bank's profit-making products like lending. Varo will never go profit, it's the VC's money that keeping it afloat far now once that dry's up then it is destined to sink. Varo right now makes revenue through ATM fees, they leech these poor people. So if you are thinking that its the next Chime then it's not. Bay Area has enough fintech startups, this is not the one.
3. Other new banks dont have a bank charter, they invest in company's growth and making great products. Varo claims that bank charter is their strength but its not, they spent more than $125 million of VC money to get this charter and now they are regulated like any other bank which is expensive. I think they should have not got the charter so early. SOFI got the bank charter 12 yrs after getting founded, for the first 10 yrs their focus was user growth.
4. Varo compares itself with SOFI and valued its stock at $7.88 but SOFI is 8 times bigger than Varo and is profitable, SOFI's stock is $6.5 (Aug 2022). Money Lion stock is $1.25 and they are 3 times bigger than Varo, I think Varo is a penny stock. I will short Varo if I can.
5. Varo uses diversity and inclusion only in its marketing, in my 6 months there, I have not seen a single person of color. Just check their CEO, CPO, CMO, its a complete whitewash. Having few Chinese and Indians in a Silicon Vally company does count.",3,1,"",""

You've got a logistics network management team that are blatantly uninterested in people, just look at the way they pay their self employed drivers! If your route is planned at 10 hours, it's likely to take 13, but you only get paid for the 10, they caveat that with if it takes 7 you get the 10..... that never happens by the way. If you sift through the reviews you'll see many of them aren't favourable at all, best way to combat that.... Ask people to write good reviews.... but only those they know to be happy.

At first I was excited about my career here, though quickly came to realize that vertical movement was entirely dependent on how much you could suck up to the bosses, how loud you were, and how much you would let work intrude on your personal life. I've seen people describe this place as an ""environment for self starters"" and ""not for those who are lazy"" but that's just another way of saying they will use and abuse those who put up with it, and those who want to be treated with respect are fired. I saw dozens of people go through the company like a revolving door. The owner refuses to censor himself and would make lewd remarks on a daily basis to the point HR had to follow him around. He'd make a show of having employees of minority groups for his own optics at company parties and on calls, while also forgetting their names on regular weekdays. I know for a fact that the female employees who I worked with made 20% less than I did as a new hire. Many of their senior employees openly admitted to me that they were racist and/or sexist, patting me on the back for that previous fact that I was making more than my female Indian coworkers and saying there's nothing wrong with it. Management was aware of this and turned a blind eye to it. In addition there were a handful of scandals through the years of their favorite employees needing to be bailed out of jail, and the owners would personally step in to sweep it under the rug.

The commeraderie between peers was great.","There are so many cons! 

Let's start with the leadership team which is likely the worst part about RapidDeploy: 

The CEO is THE WORST. 
He manipulates, abuses and threatens his staff. He makes promises to customers that the company cannot uphold. He pretends to care, but actually only cares about himself. He needs to go in order for the company to succeed. He refuses to listen to the top talent that the company hires and does what he wants anyways. The staff turn around in the C-Suite is shocking, I suspect it is because nobody can work with such an ego-maniac. 

There are C-Level Execs who milk the system for their own benefit, spending all day on personal stuff while raking in huge salaries all while BSing their way through. Anyone who tries to challenge this is worked out and this is in large part of why the company is where is. 

There is a lot of nepotism. Old school friends and the like who have been hired and put into positions where they are not qualified to be. Many work at the company, earning huge salaries, while providing very little value. 

Leadership does not take any responsibility for anything that goes wrong. The way in which over 100 people were laid off was disgusting to say the least. There was a Teams call one week before Christmas, during which the CEO announced said lay-offs and was never heard from again. Not even so much as an apology. Absolute radio silence from the man who has so much to say normally was not only cowardly, but also a massive slap in the face to everyone who had been working tirelessly to make the company a success. For months and months we were told that the company is doing great. Another indication that the leadership team has no idea what they are doing.

After 100+ people were laid off with very a basic severance, the remaining company received bonuses. Very publicly at that too. This was in such bad taste. 

RapidDeploy hires people wrecklessly, and often those people end up having side-lined careers. There is very much a culture of throw8ng people at problems but then not listening to what the solution would really be. Everyone who joins is considered the next best thing, only to be sidelined by the next person. You'll almost NEVER be good enough and will likely be overlooked for new talent every single time. 

There is no desire to upskill existing talent. When approaching the management to do certain courses, they will try to talk you out of it or will try put it off. However, in interviews the approach is different and candidates are sold a dream.

When the rot started to show, several negative reviews were noted here on Glass Door. Management then went on a campaign to up the ratings, which is why there are positive reviews with similar wording. 

There are too many chief's, not enough indians. Everyone wants to be a manager with a fancy title, but not many know what they are doing. Fancy titles at RapidDeploy really glorify basic positions that should not be management level. 

After months and months of telling people not to worry, the ship took on major water and had to rid itself of over 100 employees. Over 100 families were affected by this and South African Employees are still awaiting severance pay outs. 

The fact of the matter is, stay away, they will sell you dreams, derail your career and lie to you every step of the way. Trust in management has been lost completely and it won't be long before more people leave and the doors close for good. Everyone wants to have fancy titles, high paying salaries and then make it seem like they are doing you a favor when you actually expect them to do their jobs.",1,1,"",""

Under appreciated yet still so loyal and hard working.","Where to even start. 
First, I am typically not a person to leave a bad review, talk badly about places or people openly on the internet, or complain about working hard. I love hard work, I value hard work, and I was so excited to work somewhere that had the same values. I am also very active in the CrossFit community and was looking forward to being a part of the very beginning and heart of what makes CrossFit, CrossFit. Unfortunately, I left feeling like an object. Less than a number. A tally on a sheet that was ultimately deemed “overstaffed” (yes, they had an excel sheet viewable that told you whether you were considered under or over staffed). 
While I spent the majority of my 1.5 years in my role putting up with the constant pay cuts, lack of planning, asinine performance reviews, insane overtime during the holidays, denied PTO requests, virtually no training for new hires or other employees moving around, and egotistical managers, I stayed. I told myself I was apart of something special. While they shoved us in the trenches, we all remained loyal and continued to work hard—and good. Many people were approved to continue working remotely from “approved” states, some even being told the approval came straight from Caity. When we were told to come back to the office or be fired, no exception was given for people with special circumstances (ie military spouse). For a veteran owned company and claiming to be so “military friendly” this disgusted mostly everyone.
 Any conversation with a higher level manager about concerns resulted in a lecture while they tried to convince you in any way possible to make it make sense…. and they were ALWAYS right, even when they were wrong. Every conversation was left feeling like a scorned child who embarrassed their parent in public. 
Performance reviews were basically pointless and showed no linear progression of your actual work or performance. There was virtually no feedback and half of management doesn’t even know what you do. When asking why my score went down, I was told it was still an “excellent score” and I shouldn’t care. “you should have never got the first score to begin with (from a previous manager) because it’s unrealistic for your position” was what I was told. 
The pay cuts were a huge talking point, and I somewhat understood some of the cuts post Covid. By the end, the “competitive wage” they boast about was not competitive. But if you check out the prize purse for their event and athletes, you’ll clearly see where all of the employee cuts went. 

I could go on forever, but what sealed the deal was when I sent my resignation, not a single member of management so much as acknowledged it. I was left on my last day questioning if they even knew it was my last day. The cherry on top was none of management said a word to me on my last day, with the exception of my shift supervisor. If that doesn’t show they literally DONT CARE about you, I can’t convince you anything would. 
I even waited weeks to post this review, thinking maybe I was crazy and every place of employment acts this way. After my first few weeks at a new job I can confidently say Rogue is the worst workplace I’ve ever experienced. No one should treat their employees the way they have and get away with it.

I've been able to see the company truly grow over that period and one of the coolest things that I can say about the company is how transparent it has always been. Through that transparency, whether it be company all-hands meetings, reports, or general announcements in communications, you are highly exposed to how the business as a whole operates, the relevant KPIs and metrics across departments, and the key strategies to consistently achieve super aggressive goals. Seeing all of these things, at that level detail, get planned, executed, and reported on a regular basis is really educational regardless of what department you are even working in. 

From what I have experienced, having this level of understanding of the business allows teams to practice a much higher degree of autonomy when it comes to delivering work. Teams know what data is relevant to delivering success and are then encouraged to figure out how to best achieve that...directives for features are not really just given to you from the top-down, it's very much driven by the team and makes it much more rewarding and interesting. Teams are also free to use whatever methodology they see appropriate for how they work. If it doesn’t work for your team, you have the power to change it with your team and that's pretty cool.

Not everything has been a smooth ride though, there have been a few bumps along the road, but bumps are unavoidable and I will say that every step of the way, they are asking you ""What can we do better? What's working? What isn't working"" and then they actually take action on the results of those answers. People will listen and there are many ways to have your voice heard in this organization: anonymous + public Q&amp;A, 1+1's, surveys, polls. There is a lot of input to give if you have it. 

The tech stack is modern and pretty fun to work with. There is an effective CI/CD pipeline that generally makes deploys and preview environments very simple…makes the process of working on a ticket, spinning up a preview environment, QA’ing, and then deploying to production super easy. They use/implement feature flags, AB testing, a Design Language System, interaction metrics, automated testing, observability, and real user monitoring. Lots of opportunities to get hands-on experience with many relevant technologies and paradigms. 

I think Everlywell tries hard to keep you engaged with the organization and with the team, especially throughout the pandemic. Between the DEI ERG and the Product + Engineering Culture Committee, there are a lot of valuable activities and programming to take in, if you want to attend. I also appreciate that the company does not ignore the events of the world and acknowledges insane things that are happening. It's nice to be able to feel like a bunch of humans together. Even while being fully remote, I feel like I was able to stay engaged and feel like part of a team, in a non-corny or annoying type of way.

Overall, Everlywell is a great place to be if you want to work with really cool people, learn a lot, and have opportunities to make a big impact.

Other Pros:
* Unlimited PTO (never had an issue getting time off)
* company match for charitable donations
* free tests
* educational stipend
* full time remote","There can be a lot of meetings, but you are also encouraged (by the CEO) to decline meetings that have no agenda. 

There is a big emphasis on OKR’s and goal setting, which is a Pro and helpful from the perspective of career growth within the company, but it also makes for quite a bit of extra administration work. It can be hard to make time to focus on those things sometimes. 

From my experience at Everlywell, it has always been a bit challenging to minimize context switching. Things move fast and it feels like you do get pulled in a few different directions from time to time. This can make it hard to focus sometimes. 

It is always heavily encouraged to attend meetings with your camera on...that can be bleh at times depending on what type of person you are, but isn't really a huge deal.

Teams tend to change frequently (or have in the past), so it can be challenging to get past the forming stage of a team to the point where you really hit your stride and become predictable...which can be frustrating. This is kind of just a symptom of fast growth though...new teams need to come from somewhere I suppose. 

There is a lot going on and can feel a bit overwhelming to keep up with at times - There is a lot of interesting work happening so it can definitely feel like a balancing act...but I feel like I have seen this skewing in a more focused direction between teams over the last year(s) which has been cool to see. 

I feel like most of my cons are probably common to any company at this stage though. It's hard to grow and deal with changes...I think Everlywell stands out in how they really try to make these unavoidable speed bumps as smooth as possible.",4,4,"",""

Also, the bar on productivity was set so incredibly low here. This is, on the flip side, a great place to work for lazy devs who are tired of keeping up with new technology changes, or sunsetting devs who are ready to cruise into retirement. Or hey, if you're into being overemployed, this is one of those jobs that would be great for it. 

I really have no ill-will towards this company even though they pretty much lied to me during the interview process as far as the role I was getting hired on to do and the work that I actually ended up doing, which was mainly Microsoft Dynamics work and very, very little coding. I just want to warn any future prospective employees that they should set their expectations pretty low if they get hired on here.

There are so many leaders here that should not be leaders - they are wildly unqualified and fail to grasp the basics of their role. These people create an endless amount of meaningless work in order to try to prove their relevancy. These leaders are causing the sparse remaining talent to leave in droves. 

When i spoke up to my manager about my profound unhappiness in my role due to micromanagement and being over worked - i was questioned about what was going on outside of work to cause such stress for me. It was never accepted or acknowledged that Collibra was the problem, and it was implied that it was my fault or my personal life that was prohibiting me from thriving here. I was told to feel empowered speak up about being underwater, but every time i spoke up i was told to have growth mindset. This place made me feel like a failure, but in hindsight i was set up to fail. Any ideas or thoughts I shared about changing process or questioning the status quo was met with confusion at best, or hostility &amp; patronization at worst. 

I have been removed from this company for enough time to reflect upon my experience at Collibra clearly, and I can confidently say this was the worst experience of my professional life. The BOH systems are absolutely not in the place they need to be for a company of this size (far too much is still managed in excel or google sheets). Different teams are in different places with the quality of their data and systems which makes it incredibly challenging (read impossible) to work cross functionally. Over the two years I spent here - nothing changed, nothing improved.

Recently they started an entire purge of teachers if they don't comply with their new invasive background checks made by a third party without giving any knowledge as to how this really personal and private data is processed and who it is shared with. Accounts of the teachers who didn't comply were deactivated, posts on the teacher's forum where people were just asking honest questions about this situation were deleted and many people who were desperate enough to comply also lost their accounts (and often their main source of income) because the website of the company making the checks had various technical issues that didn't allow some people to complete them. I've read a few heart-wrenching pleas of teachers about to lose all of their students either because they didn't feel safe with a random company acquiring all their data or because they couldn't complete the check due to technical problems with the website or because they lived in countries where it might not have been safe to do so. Some teachers based in the UK asked if they could simply complete a DBS check but that of course didn't satisfy verbling either. Not only does this shady practise affects teachers' lives but students as well, because - surprise! - none of them were given refunds! Without any notice they were just given their verbling credit back and had their classes cancelled without any explanation when their teacher's account was deactivated. If they are learning a less popular language there are often no other teachers available so they can't transfer that credit to someone else and even if they can it's still highly unethical not to offer a refund. Considering how much verbling pushed students to buy 10 or 20 hours packages many students lost hundreds of dollars that they can't get back. What's most upsetting about this whole situation is how completely unnecessary it is - I've never heard of anything like that happening on any other teaching platform.

-Attitudes are very poor, especially from leadership, very negative and not solution orientated.  Leaders will argue with each other in group meetings.
-Unpleasant culture, not forward thinking, strategic or looking for ways to improve.
-Sourcing and overseas vendors do not support the customers needs and on trend development.  This involves presenting ideas to customers that are old or not fully developed, tested or executed, resulting in reactionary steps on the back end.
-Domestic QA is a joke, not sure what they do, always complain, not helpful in finding solutions or proactive planning.
-The corporate office is unique but outdated, invest in the right organizational tools, storage, workrooms, offices, gathering spaces and technology to support a team that must go into the office.",2,1,"",""

The DMs mistakes are your fault.

Turnover rate is very high. Expect to get called in on your days off. 

They will treat you as lesser if you can't work 6-7 days a week.

The computer systems are very old and most logs are still on paper.

They will not train you properly at most stores.

If you're a keyholder, you better have experience because they will not tell you how to open or close, they will give you the answers to the training test and tell you they'll actually teach you later, but then they won't.

If you have an issue with management, they will not give you a chance to respond. 

If a customer complains, they will hold it against you and never speak to you directly, or just not inform you at all until its convenient for them to do so.

They only schedule 2 people a shift, even while training. Store managers will get yelled at for OT during this too.

They have one guy managing a ton of stores where I'm at, and he doesn't pay attention or listen to anyone other than the store manager, unless it's convenient for him to do so.

When my former store manager walked out due to declining mental health and stress, the DM tried to manipulate them into coming back.

The pay for every position is abysmal. Associates make minimum wage, but because they are usually at the register and make 7% commission, they often make more than the keyholders, who are usually doing shipment/cleaning because the associates are not trained properly. 

The store manager position usually starts at less than 16 an hour.

The store is always a mess and the DM would complain about it but wouldn't give us the time or people to clean it up.

The management does not care about their employees.

All of the shoes are on the floor so they will be stolen and damaged by customers daily. People will leave trash and empty boxes everywhere.

The dress code is outdated, they make you buy your own shirt if they don't have any, they have an order form to get shirts but they either never did it or you have to pay for them. 

Dress code is only enforced by DM, and they don't even list it properly on the paperwork.

So was my team. The phones are bugged; meetings are listened in on. Reviews with the regional president are nightmarish. He tells you how to prepare then does the opposite of what he says he will do. He sat in the back of a dark room and degraded my team, my progress, everything I did while I had to look ahead and was advised not to turn around to speak to him. I was told what colors to wear on those review days. I was told not to wear lotion or perfume or too much jewelry because it “offended him”. While being spoken to like an idiot, I was told to just sit there and listen and never talk back. What kind of workplace is that? As for the work scope - it’s impossible. If 100 kids graduate, you’re expected to place 100 kids in jobs. If you place 99, they ask why you didn’t place 100. The problem was places wouldn’t hire Remington students because the education they get isn’t good enough to get them hired. While cold calling to try and place students in jobs, employers would ask what school I was calling from. When I told them Remington, sometimes they would say “we don’t hire Remington students”. Sometimes they would just hang up. If the regional career services director is feeling pressured enough, they’ll tell you to fudge the numbers - and they’re ALWAYS feeling pressured. Remington is an awful diploma mill and every location should be forced to shut its doors. Please avoid it. You won’t last long anyway - they don’t keep anyone long.

One on one model allows you to see what strategies are effective/ineffective in a relatively short period of time, which is difficult in a large classroom setting. As you gain more experience teaching, and your knowledge and comfort level in your subject areas grow, and you can bring in resources/tools/learning platforms into your class, which you can use to expand on your craft. Ability to teach basically any class that you would want, is a good opportunity to get experience, especially when it comes to AP courses. There are many highly talented and hard working teachers who are very collaborative, supportive of each other and collegial. Opportunities exist to be an advisor in student groups/clubs during lunch, if one chooses.","High Turnover: Very high teacher and front desk staff turnover. Little to no investment made in staff retention, described by upper administration  as a “stepping stone” job. High turnover creates lack of continuity for students, and constant loss of experienced and talented staff. School seems to either be in denial about this issue or not actually care/realize how such high amounts of staff turnover damages the schools capacity/ability/effectiveness to serve the vulnerable population of students that Tilden serves. The faculty page for the Albany and Walnut Creek campuses have been blank for months. 

Lack of Adequate Teacher Training: Very little training is given towards working with students with learning differences. The very limited teacher training that does exist (20 minutes, once a week, during teacher preparation time) is often topical due to limited time, and does not allow each topic the time and attention that it needs/deserves. Trainings seem to be targeted more toward satisfying reporting requirements rather than actually for the benefit of staff and students. 

Prep Time: An inadequate amount of  time is given for  preparation for one on one class instruction. 1 hour of preparation time is given for every 10 hours of instructional time which is paid at the reduced rate of  $20 an hour (which is well below the $32-$37 an hour pay range for teachers) This inadequacy and devalorization runs in contradiction to one of the schools main points of emphasis of  providing quality individualized instruction. Any class cancellations count against accrued preparation time. 

No Human Resources:  Disciplinary issues are currently handled by upper administration which is a conflict of interest if issues arise involving a member of the upper administrative team. There is an outside HR consultant that is called in at the discretion of upper administration. Day to day HR issues are handled by a member of upper administration who also handles employee benefits/health insurance questions/issues. 

Bullying/Unprofessional Behavior/Nepotism: There has been a long history of unprofessional, bullying and retaliatory behavior perpetuated by current members of the upper administrative team including those who are in charge of curriculum and HR/benefits, who for years has been able to comport themselves in this way with impunity. Numerous complaints (documented &amp; verbal) have been made to the current founders of the school and other persons on the upper management leadership team for years to no effect. Instead, upper management  has acted to ignore, enable, excuse and cover up this behavior to the detriment of teachers, staff, and the school culture. Additionally, over the years many of the top leadership positions have been awarded not through merit and ability, but through a combination of nepotism and as a means to reward those who do not question /are not critical of the decisions made/ actions taken  by members of the upper management team. This encourages  pettiness, immaturity, vindictiveness, insecurity, gossip and insincerity to permeate through the upper levels of the school leadership. All of this creates an environment that is unproductive, toxic, incompetent and uncaring, which has greatly worsened in the last couple of years. 

Other Issues: 

Lack of real control / teacher feedback / collaboration in regards to the development of curriculum. 

No CFO or Controller exists within the school.  

Logistically, administratively and curriculum wise the school is consistently reactive instead of proactive.",2,1,"",""

- Solid and repeatable commercial model which incentivises 'good' behaviour and prioritises service efficacy

- Good focus on employee wellbeing

- Some truly remarkable successes and that's a testament to the model, the technology and the entire team. 

- A lot of trust from management enables a lot of great work that most don't even see.","Overall, a very positive experience, most issues are going to be common for organisations this size and anyone joining will need an element of patience while the org grows into the sector, but that shouldn't dissuade anyone from joining. 

- Can feel a little too much like 'move fast and break things' at times

- Feedback is generally acted on, but sometimes not visibly or quickly - there's no faster way to lose trust than to make people feel like they're not listened to.

- Volume and pace of work forces team to be reactive more often than necessary... hiring has been a struggle (not unique to Beam) and a reason for this: If you think you'll need someone to do a job in a year, starting looking for them now.",3,3,"",""

Time off around the holidays.","Many believe that the pay is low because this is the sports industry. However, there is more than enough money to go around. Executives spend more money on dinners, alcohol and travel (often for themselves, not prospects/clients) than one can imagine. Before COVID they would travel on private/semi-private jets to daily/weekly meetings when this could be done over the phone/zoom. Money doesn’t seem to be a problem for this, yet they’re comfortable paying entry-level positions $30k/year.

Commissions is confusing and it comes down to the size of the book you inherit. If you have a small book, you can bring in a ton of money into the company and see only a fraction of a percent of that you brought in.

There are certainly perks with working in sports (tickets, meals, gear, etc.) however the technical “benefits” are pretty weak. There is no 401k match - I’ve never seen a company of this size have zero 401k match.

Every month it’s a new big initiative that everyone needs to drop everything and run to. But they also don’t communicate with teams so multiple teams are likely working on similar things. There’s been 4 reorgs in 6 months. Management continues to say we aren’t doing layoffs and shortly after there’s layoffs. In a company meeting to explain the last layoffs. The C Level told everyone this is how this company works, if you don’t like it … leave. There’s no job security in life so we aren’t going to try and rebuild the trust we lost by lying and laying folks off. (Clearly great leadership) Everything is constantly breaking because the company literally doesn’t care at all about quality. Their version of “quality” is a slack channel where the CEO talks about if buttons are 1 or 2 pixels off. So everyone is fighting fires constantly. The tech is horribly outdated, and they do nothing to improve it because we have “features” that are more important. Directors and above do not care about engineers or managers. There is blatant favoritism, and the only way to move up. The CTO wants people to quit as a goal, to “make sure some roles are hard enough”. While the company constantly signs flashy new deals. The outlook for SeatGeek is very very poor, they won’t say it but everyone can see the writing on the wall. There is zero learning and development, culture is horrible. Everyone is over worked. Their version of culture is acting like frat boys and getting drunk after work every day. I could write for days on everything horrible with this company but what’s the point.

For juniors and foreigners looking for a starting career in Singapore, this company is a good stepping stone; the company seems to prefer hiring low wage workers before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, this may change in 2023 as minium wages rise. The pattern for juniors and foreigners is to work about 1-2 years and switch to other company. See the cons for long-term career consideration in this company. 2. Diversity exists, but seems in a bad way (see cons). 3. There is annual company stock discount for all full-times. 4. There is online learning coverage for Udemy and Coursera. 5. Working culture is hybrid for non-critical businesses. Government business and manufacturing are still on-site. 6. Work-life balance is pretty good. There will be no WLB when deadlines are close though. 7. IT technology (VPN, automatic software updates, etc) is good enough.","1. Salary is below the market average, yet job roles can be demanding. However, this may change in 2023 as minium wages rise. 2. Diversity, mostly are Indonesian, Filipino, Indian, Vietnamese, is likely due to the above point. My previous project leader who was a fresh grad from Indonesia university was pissed off knowing my starting salary was higher than his. 3. Promotion is based on both seniority and pleasing the management / French people rather than merits / skills. The effect is brilliant people leave after about 2-3 years of working and those in technical and management roles are filled with the average or bad ones. 4. Turnover rate is high and this company even gives 2000 SGD for a successful candidate hiring recommendation, close to what this company gives for a successful patent (1000-1500 EUR). 5. There are several high-ego managers and toxic colleagues. Sabotage and backstabbing do exist and you will be hardly be able to protect yourself when dealing with these toxic people. See point 3 on why this is happening. 6. Codebase for development, production, and unit test code are chaotic. It gives headache just to read them and make you think everyone in this company is an amateur at best. See point 3 on why this is happening. 7. Project leaders and managers do not strive for good development practice. Code refactoring is treated as a burden and unprofessional, coding shortcuts are perceived as brilliant and professional, and most teams have their agile development as just ""being agile"" with short daily stand-up as 1-1-5 hour daily reporting. See point 3 on why this is happening. 8. Most French colleagues I have worked with are cunning, self-entitled, and arrogant towards Asian. Some of them (expats) is incompetent and they make themselves as the most impactful contributor. Yet, they have the highest salary among locals. They mostly appear nice, which is why it is hard to identify this issue. 9. Politics are strong in higher managements, especially if it is related to French people. 10. Not many brilliant people to work with and the experts' expertise are questionable. This is a cybersecurity company focused on applied cryptography and yet, most people inside do not have strong cryptography knowledge. Nobody even cares good software development practice. 11. There is not much career progression for higher positions. 12. Health insurance coverages are average; no dental and annual health screening coverage. 13. The HR technology is bad. HR uses Workday for performance review and company structure, but other than that, it uses Oracle technology (as far as I remember). Critical aspects such as claiming benefits, downloading payrolls, applying leaves, filling monthly check-ins become hellish. 14. Never trust anonymous survey as being anonymous no matter what the managements say. I have had my hard lesson.",3,1,"",""
